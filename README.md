# test-bot

This is a repository that was created for practice

Current bot slash commands:

```
/ping
/cat
/avatar [user]
/user
/newrole [name]
/server
```

Run `node node deploy-commands.js` to register the commands for the guild, and `node .` to start the bot and login.
Must create your own config.json file first.
